Hi thereðŸ‘‹,

My name is Sola Adeoye. I have spent the last 4 years of my life navigating the niche of Financial and Business Analysis, and now studying for an MSc. in Data Science at the University of Salford. I'm an incredibly curious person by nature and have a keen interest in exploring what goes on in the backend, and how we can leverage the now gotten information into making insightful decisions for organizations. This github profile contains all the data science related projects completed by me for my academic, self-learning and hubby purposes. I have personal and academic projects using R, Databricks, Tableau and Saas.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning; R, Python, SQL, Tableau and Cloud Engineering.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with other life-long learners like myself in contributing to projects that'll buttress my knowledge of these niches.
